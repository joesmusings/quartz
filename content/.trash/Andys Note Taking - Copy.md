- Principles
	- You should track how many evergreen notes you write - that should be the key metric you strive for as a thinker
	- The problem with note taking
		- the majority of content focuses around the surface level apps and tools you should use
		- "People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use"
		- the goal isn't to take better notes, it's to think better
		- most systems have little to no interaction with your notes over time, letting sub-par note taking slide and never letting you give yourself feedback
	- The work you do should build on itself, one-off note taking and writings should become a part of a process that lets knowlesge build
		- "We should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time."
		- writing evergreen notes does this - requiring dissection, connections, etc
	- Literature notes
		- purpose: "help you write durable notes"
			- there for later look up
			- links to evergreen notes
			- "create an opportunity to explicitly curate key durable notes associated with a note. This might be important for cutting through the noise, especially if a reference is mentioned frequently."
		- should be
			- reference specific
			- brief
			- separated from the rest of the system
			- "typically a lightweight synthesis of observations collected while reading"
		- definition comes from How to Take Smart Notes
			- You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.
			  
			  Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.
	- Processing reading notes into evergreen
		- input: marked passages & notes about your thoughts
		- how to decide what to write
			- "evergreen notes should be concept-oriented", so choose the key concepts
		- take a step back and get a look at the overall picture
			- cluster scraps into piles and see what emerges
			- or mind map/visual outline
		- once you have a sense of the concepts, you write the notes
			- from https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/
			- 1. write a broad note to capture the big idea
			- 2. write smaller notes that capture the "nuanced atomic ideas"
			- 3. connect to past notes : link, merge, revise
			- 4. revise the broad note and improve it based on what you've connected
	- make sure to have a method to capture notes on the go, ex. andy uses an A7 notepad and pen.
	- writing inbox
		- you want to be able to capture one off ideas effortlessly and develop them into evergreen notes eventually
			- 1. should be quick to capture & separate from evergreen notes
			- 2. should reliably be drained
				- reduce inputs
				- increase processing, ex create a routine
		- many notes here end up as evergreen notes 
			- if after a few passes it doesn't look interesting, then archive or delete it
	- reading inbox
		- have one spot to capture things
		- don't auto import
		- processing
			- trash it, doesn't look valuable
			- read it seriously
			- read it lightly and file in a reference library
			- file in other list (like recipes to try) 
		- important feautres
			- easy capture
			- easy reading
			- easy "listing across item type"(?)
			- obvious when something has been passed over multiple times
				- no app really does this


- thinking and note-writing
	- evergreen notes can help:
		- leaps of insight
		- develop wild ideas
		- increase conversational bandwidth
	- how to use spaced repetition
		- maybe I could add a "last reviewed" date to notes

- writing and note-writing
	- "executable strategy for writing"
		- focus is to create evergreen notes that allow you to "publish things" more of an editing job than a writing job
		- two main ways of writing
			- bottom up
				- write evergreen notes while reading and thinking
				- when you create a new note, add it to an outline for a piece (or add a new one)
				- eventually, you'll want to write from one of those outlines
				- write new notes to fill in the missing parts
				- put all of those together for a first draft
				- rewrite
			- top down
				- review your notes on a topic
				- write an outline
				- attach notes to each part of the outline and write new notes where needed
				- put all of those together for a first draft
				- rewrite
			- 

- structure of the notes
	- evergreen notes should be written for yourself, not for anyone else
- associative structure

## Rabbit holes
- The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading
	- [Link](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6GNVv6RyFDewy11ZgXzce8agWxSLwJ6Ub5Rw)
		- "It’s not that they’ve so deeply internalized and automatized those practices that they seem invisible: they’re just not doing those things."
		- "They read for a purpose"
		- ["Many eminent thinkers need a writing surface to think"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2)
	- Cal Newport talks about this too
	- So then whats the solve?
		- Should the process naturally evolve? Instead of using someone else's process?
		- Is there some sort of simple baseline that people use that is a common thread between them all?
		- It's possible that we just need more effective engagement with the material. More time and space to actually think. It comes down to a balance of not being system-obsessed, rather content-obsessed. 
			- The truth is it doesn't matter what sort of system you have. The more time you spend concerned on the system is the less time you can focus on the content.
			- The technology and system stack is there to serve you. It's there to personalize the workflow to the way that works best with you. 
			- The big thinkers who have messy desks with papers notes and books strewn about, that's their personal system. 
			- Its about adapting the personal side of it to you
