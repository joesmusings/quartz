what is discipline? how do we create it? is it good? why discipline?

## definition
consistent action in-line with the rules that are set by or for you
- though it has a heavy 'punishment' undertone, ex. to "discipline" someone - "using punishment to correct disobedience"

there's a part of yourself that sets & enforces the rules, and a part of you that has to follow them. but what happens if you fail? you beat yourself up, and its a negative spiral downwards.
- will those negative emotions, self-flagellation, help you with consistent action? has it in the past?



## why discipline

At the end of the day, what we really want is consistency. We want out actions to add up over time and culminate in something greater.
