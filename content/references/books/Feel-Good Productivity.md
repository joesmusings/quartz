## Play

|                     | Experiment #1                               | Experiment #2                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Create an adventure | Choose your character                       | Embrace your curiosity       |
| Find the fun        | "What would this look like if it were fun?" | Enjoy the process            |
| Lower the stakes    | Reframe your failure                        | Don't be serious, be sincere |
Choose your character:
- "identifying the type of play that most resonates with who you are, so you can choose a type of player to embody"
- Dr. Stuart Brown's research came up with the following play personalities
	- The Collector
	- The Competitor
	- The Explorer
	- The Creator
	- The Storyteller
	- The Joker
	- The Director
	- The Kinesthete

## Power

|  | Experiment #1 | Experiment #2 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Boost your confidence | The confidence switch (positive self talk) | Social Model Method (see others do it) |
| Level up your skills | Shoshin Approach(beginner's mind) | Protege Effect (teach others) |
| Take ownership | Own the process | Own your mindset |

Social Model Method:
- Albert Bandura: "Seeing people similar to oneself succeed by sustained effort raises observers' beliefs that they too possess the capabilities to master comparable activities to succeed"
	- This is why everyone should be sharing their story online, their process, the whole [[anti-creator]] thing
The Protege Effect:
- "Seneca said, *Qui docet discit* - 'He who teaches learns'
- "the people we learn from best are often the ones who are just a step ahead of us in the journey"
- "You don't need to be a guru. You can just be a guide."

Take ownership:
- [ ] Look into psychologist Edward Deci & Richard Ryan
	- he talks about what motivates people to do hard things
- "But what makes the concept of ownership so powerful is that you can integrate it into almost any situation."
Own the process:
- "When we can't take ownership of the situation, we can still take ownership of the process."
Own your mindset:
- "Simply switching their mindset from 'have to' to 'choose to' they boosted their sense of control, power and, in turn, what they were capable of. "
## People

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Find your scene | The comrade mindset (teamwork) | Find synchronicity (body double) |
| Feel the helpers high | Random acts of kindness | Ask for help |

# Unblock

## Clarity

|            | Experiment #1             | Experiment #2       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Ask 'why'  | Using commander's intent  | The five whys       |
| Ask 'what' | NICE goals                | Crystal ball method |
| Ask 'when' | Implementation intentions | Time blocking       |

- "procrastination is caused by negative feelings"
- "uncertainty paralysis"
	- "when we become overwhelmed by the unknowns or the complexity of a situation"

Using commander's intent:
- "The military generals' detailed orders hadn't worked. The specific plans they'd laid out went awry. But because they'd communicated their commander's intent, everyone involved in the operation knew the *purpose*. The 'why' was clear, and that made it possible to work out an alternative 'how'."

NICE goals:
- Near-term
- Input-based
- Controllable
- Energizing

Crystal-ball method:
- prospective hindsight
	- "the process of imagining that an even has already occurred - increases our ability to identify why things will go right (or wrong) by 30 per cent"

## Courage

|  | Experiment #1 | Experiment #2 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Know your fear | The emotional label | The identity label |
| Reduce your fear | The 10/10/10 rule | The confidence equation |
| Overcome your fear | Stop spotlighting | The batman effect |
The emotional label:
- "When you're procrastinating, say to yourself, 'What am I afraid of?'"
- "Next... ask yourself, 'Where does this feat come from?"

## Get Started

|  | Experiment #1 | Experiment #2 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Reduce friction | Reduce environmental friction | Reduce emotional friction |
| Take action | Define the next action step | Track your progress |

Define the next action step:

# Sustain

## Conserve

|                    | Experiment #1                   | Experiment #2                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Do less            | The energy investment portfolio | The power of no                 |
| Resist distraction | Add friction                    | Correct course                  |
| Break more         | Schedule your breaks            | Embrace energizing distractions |
The energy investment portfolio:
- "The idea of the 'energy investment portfolio' is simple. You simply come up with two lists. List A is a list of all your dreams, hopes, and ambitions. These are things you would like to do at some point, just probably not right now. List B is a list of your active investments. These are the projects you're actively investing energy into right now (or want to be). And by right now, I mean this week."
- "If you want to move a dream into your active investments list, you need to make sure you've got the time and energy to invest in it."

## Align

|  | Experiment #1 | Experiment #2 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Long term | The eulogy method | The odyssey plan |
| Medium term | The wheel of life | The 12 month celebration |
| Short term | Three alignment quests | Alignment experiments |
- 'relative autonomy continuum' - developed by Kennon Sheldon
	- External Motivation - showing off
	- Introjected Motivation - I'd feel guilty if i didn't
		- (maybe conflict with identity?)
	- Identified Motivation - this'll help me w/ goals
	- Intrinsic Motivation - love the work
- "those who had higher levels of both introjected and identified motivation were far more likely to complete the trail" (when intrinsic motivation waned)
- "the only type of extrinsic motivation that corresponded with greater happiness was identified motivation"

Medium-term:
- 'values affirmation interventions'
	- "a scientific term for identifying your core personal values right now, and continually reflecting on them"

Alignment experiments:
- How
	- 1. "identify an area of your life where your actions feel particularly unfulfilling"
	- 2. "come up with your hypothesis" (independent variable, and what it'll effect)
	- 3. "execute. Make a change. And as you do so, what effect it has on your situation"
- "keep track of the effects. Try keeping a log or journal"
