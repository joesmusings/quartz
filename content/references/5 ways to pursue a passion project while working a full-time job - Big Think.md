> ### Practice the 5 of 7 rule 


> Eckerling’s “5 of 7 rule,” which provides the flexibility to decide how many days you can realistically work on your project per week. Most opt for five of seven days, but it can be fewer, too. 


> ### Track your progress 


> “After you complete whatever task during each designated passion project time, make a note about your progress within the appointment,” she says. That way, “at the end of the week or month, if you are frustrated that you didn’t get more done, you can look at your calendar and be proud of your accomplishments and dedication.”

> “If you’re chronically sleep deprived, you won’t have the energy or the creativity you will need to pick up that side gig at the end of a long day,”
