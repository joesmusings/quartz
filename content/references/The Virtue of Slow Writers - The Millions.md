> Books known for their protracted writing time—10, 20 years or more—span genre, length, and era. **Salinger**’s [_Catcher in the Rye_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316769177/ref=nosim/themillpw-20), 10 years. **Min Jin Lee**’s [_Pachinko_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1455563927/ref=nosim/themillpw-20), 28 years—and 11 for her debut, [_Free Food for Millionaires_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/153872202X/ref=nosim/themillpw-20). **Edward P. Jones** imagined [_The Known World_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061159174/ref=nosim/themillpw-20) in his head for over a decade before writing it out in seven months, and **John Steinbeck** made notes for [_East of Eden_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140186395/ref=nosim/themillpw-20) for 11 years before writing it in a year of continual work. 


> there are those writers who seem to work best at a clip. **Anne Rice** wrote [_Interview with a Vampire_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345337662/ref=nosim/themillpw-20) in five weeks and **Muriel Spark** [_The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061711292/ref=nosim/themillpw-20) in less than four. **Kazuo Ishiguro** drafted [_The Remains of the Day_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679731725/ref=nosim/themillpw-20) in four weeks—achieved, he’s said, by implementing a process he calls The Crash: “do nothing but write from 9am to 10.30pm, Monday through Saturday. \[…\] One hour off for lunch and two for dinner. I’d not see, let alone answer, any mail, and would not go near the phone.” 


> In [_The Art of Slow Writing: Reflections on Time, Craft, and Creativity_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250051037/ref=nosim/themillpw-20), essayist **Louise DeSalvo** writes, “We’ve internalized the idea that that the only actions worth taking are those that can be accomplished quickly, \[…\] that if our writing takes so long, we might not be cut out for the writing life.” _The Art of Slow Writing_ is a manifesto for giving a book the time it needs, for cultivating patience and connection.
