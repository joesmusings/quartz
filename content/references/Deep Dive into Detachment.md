How do i become detached
- it isn't one things, it's a lot of different things
- we'll go through many different perspectives to end up in this one place

What is the source of our attachment?
- Avidya to our true nature
	- Avidya = lack of knowledge/ignorance
	- False identifications with our body & mind

outline
1. Dissociation/apathy
2. Desires & our relationship to the universe
	1. Grasping 
3. ego
4. karma
5. perception
6. tools
	1. meta cognition
7. jnana yoga

advanced detachment isn't about doing more or special things, it's about doing them more & more consistently
- "how do you get into shape?"
	- you can be taught on each method of exercise, and little tweaks that can help you be more efficient/effective, but it's the consistency that will really get you in shape


## jnana yoga

yoga = union/liberations
- 4 paths for yoga to lead you to enlightment
	- one of those paths is of knowledge
	- in the path of knowledge, we contemplate
	- we don't do much/see many people practice this
	- the path of contemplation is difficult
		- because our mind is not pure/is flawed

what detachment is not?
- lot of people think it means apathy, being "unplugged"
	- what is apathy? it is a very powerful attachment
	- usually these people have a core attachment or emotion that is walled off and is calloused
		- underneath the "not caring" there is a lot of caring that leads them to wall themself off
	- ex. people who have given up on dating
		- they're not detached, they're so resentful and burned, they just wall it off
		- wall off -> stop feeling -> apathy

detachment is about going all in 
- living life without worrying about the ego, consequences, etx
- ex. casino
	- the odds are not in your favor. you can calculate the odds
	- but the way you play depends on your attachments
		- the way you approach the gambling can be very different
		- if you're excited, passionate, "I can do it!" 
	- you can play the game dispassionately, calculated, or get caught up in it
- vairagya - sanskrit word for detachment
	- vai - without
	- ragya - passion, interest, color
	- living dispassionately is our goal
		- we don't just ignore the world around us, we just don't want to get caught up in it
		- you can feel emotions, have passion, but it's about not letting it be all consuming and entirely sweeping you up
	- people who are attached in life go towards what they're attracted to, and away from the things that repulse them
		- so they lose control, your emotions dictate your actions
			- casino ex. "i'm on a hot streak" and become more passionate about winning more, but the odds are still against you
	- neurosci
		- chasing our attachments is biologically impossible to get happiness
		- nucleus accumbens - you get a trigger of dopamine
			- 1st it creates pleasure
			- 2nd creates craving/anticipation
			- 3rd creates tolerance
		- do an activity 
			- 5 units of pleasure, 1 unit of tolerance, 5 units anticipation
		- "i wan't 5 units again"
			- if you win a second time
				- 4 units of pleasure, 1 unit tolerance, 5 units anticipation
		- 3rd
			- 3 units pleasure, 1 unit tolerance, 5 units anticipation
		- there's no way to win this, as you engage in the behavior more, your pleasure goes down due to your tolerance, but you still have the same craving
	- so we want to cultivate dispassion towards our life
		- you want to be like a gambler who understands there are consequences, what the odds are, but then can act appropriately
		- but when we act through our passions, we don't accurately judge the world around us, we get caught up in stuff

avoid living in the future
- don't cling to the present, don't focus on the future
- our brain has the capability to project out into the future
	- don't stop thinking about it, just stop living in it
		- ex. have a crush
			- you can act with an expectation of the future
			- or no expectation of the future
			- ex. if you buy them flowers
				- you give the gift with an expectation of something in return - not a real gift, it's a trade that you didn't know about, and you don't know what I'm expecting in return
				- if the expectation isn't met, then you suffer
- karma far
	- you're entitled to your actions, not the consequences of your actions
	- you can give someone flowers
		- you can understand the facts around it, that it'll show them you like them, that you are interested, positive emotions for the receiver
	- when you live dispassionately, removed from expectations, you're more likely to be successful
	- your mind serves a function
		- what gets us into trouble is that the mind controls us instead of us controlling the mind
		- ex. senses
			- you should enjoy tasty things, but if you let your tongue run your life, you'll end up in a world of hurt
			- it's not that you can't engage with it, just don't let it run the show
	- the future focus is the same thing
		- calculate out the future
		- but don't expect a certain result when you take that action, let go of it
		- do the best that you can, then realize that the world outside of you might have different plans
	- your suffering will come from the expectation
	- look at things in your life that you've enjoyed, 
		- look at what the expectation was, and what was the influence those expectations had on your enjoyment of the outcome
		- ex. someone telling you "this is the best movie!"
			- then you're expecting a good movie
			- otherwise, you would've been pleasantly surprised that it was good
	- living with detachment is a consistent state of pleasant surprise
- focus on the actions, don't expect a response, calculate the odds of the response you want, but recognize that its just chance

avoiding living in the past
- clinging to your glory days
- notice if your mind wanders, dwells, regret, resentment, etc
- 

what is the atomic make up of these two things?
- patterns of the mind
	- ex. if you're resentful for the past "tell me in a 5 min exp. in your life, how you're resentful for the past"
		- think about the past, emotions from the past, you don't think about the present
		- or when you look at the present, your present is colored by the experiences of the past
	- the past comes in and influence the experience of the present
		- it's not living in totality, it's the opposite
- if you look at your cognition
	- there's a slice of your mind on the present, and a slice on the past
	- any time you have fractured attention, you will not be happy
	- ex. if you're dancing
		- you can be dancing with you're entire self (totality, joy)
		- or you could be thinking about what other people think (fractured, embarrassed, reserved)
