> The [philosopher Kieran Setiya](https://bookshop.org/p/books/midlife-a-philosophical-guide-kieran-setiya/16645041?ean=9780691183282) divides our activities into two categories: _telic_ and _atelic_. Telic activities are those that we do for their end product. The purpose of telic activities is to get to the end. But atelic activities are those we do to do them. The purpose of atelic activities is that the _process_ of doing them has value. 


> I give these two types of activities a bit more conventional names: [practice and achievement](https://explorewhatworks.com/the-satisfaction-of-practice-in-an-achievement-oriented-world/). Telic activities are focused on achievement—be it mundane, utilitarian, or extraordinary. 


> the purpose of practice is awareness and groundedness, not improvement—and certainly not perfection. 

Practice is about presence, not growth. Growth is future focused and creates an expectation, a gap which we need to fill and do better than last time, leading to disappointment and using our dopamine systems. But we want to move towards more flatline, stable dopamine, avoid stimulating it too much. So presence and practice engage serotonin?

> There are plenty of ways that a loaf of bread can go wrong. And most of them are preventable if I’m paying attention. And, as Selassie points out, not only do I need to pay attention, but I need to be _kind_. If I get ticked off or frustrated by my dough because it’s not doing what I think it’s _supposed to_ be doing, it doesn’t do any good. Nor does it help if I start unkindly blaming myself. The kind way to respond is with curiosity. Why is this happening? What could I try to fix it?
