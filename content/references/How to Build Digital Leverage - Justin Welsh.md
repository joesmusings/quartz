> Want to build a lean, profitable one-person business?
> 
> One of the most powerful concepts you should know about is something I call “Digital Leverage.” 


> ## **3 Components of Digital Leverage**
> 
>   
> There are 3 simple parts to this formula.
> 
> * **Content:** Ideate 1x, Distribute 10x
> * **Selling:** Distribute 10x, Sell 100x
> * **Compounding Revenue:** Sell 100x, Incentivize 1,000x 


> ### **Part 1: Ideate 1x, Distribute 10x** 


> With my audience in mind, I research trending topics, read industry insights, and engage on social media for an hour every day. And these activities help me identify interesting ideas to write about.
> 
> After I choose a topic to write about, I create one robust, long-form piece of content— sometimes it’s a newsletter issue (like this), an article, or a [**Twitter thread**](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/03192022). 


> I break up my big, long-form content piece into smaller, more digestible pieces of content — like tweets, LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, and Instagram posts. 


> ### **Phase 2: Distribute 10x, Sell 100x**
> 
>   
> After I create 10 small pieces of content from one big idea, it’s time for distribution. 


> So I publish my smaller snippets in all the different places that make sense for each piece of content (Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, etc) 


> Every time you repurpose one strong piece of content into bite-sized posts for different platforms, you reach a wider audience with minimal effort.
> 
> Use these bite-sized social media posts as a “trojan horse” to promote your products and services. 


> ### **Phase 3: Sell 100x, Incentivize 1,000x**
> 
>   
> Selling 100 units of your product may just seem like a milestone. But it's also an opportunity to compound those sales with effective incentives. 


> Offer an **[enticing affiliate program](https://www.justinwelsh.me/affiliate%5Fusers/sign%5Fup)**, where your customers earn a commission for every new customer they refer to you. I made the decision to pay 35% rather than the standard 20% simply because I want people to feel empowered to earn. 


> But remember, you need 3 things for a win-win-win affiliate program:
> 
> 1. **A high-quality product or service:** People will only refer their friends if they truly got value from your offering.
> 2. **A good enough incentive:** You can’t pay out pennies if you expect people to keep your affiliate program top-of-mind.
> 3. **Transparency:** How does the program work? When do people get paid? What are some helpful tips for promoting or talking about your products?
