> I believe productivity is a deeply personal thing. We all have [different brains](https://markmanson.net/10-cool-things-about-the-brain) and, therefore, different preferences, perspectives, and [situations where we feel most effective](https://markmanson.net/self-discipline) 


> For example, [procrastination](https://markmanson.net/how-to-stop-procrastinating) is deeply tied to anxiety—so it’s important to develop an understanding of your own neuroses and fears.

Cal Newport talks about this in deep work 

> Every business, job, or project has what I call a leverage point that instantly makes everything else you do more effective. 


> See, solving problems is like food for your mind. It makes your mind happy. It makes it feel important and worthy and capable—all things [directly linked to happiness](https://markmanson.net/how-to-be-happy).
