> Slack is a big thing at work, and I have created an automation in [Zapier](https://zapier.com/?ref=johnny.chadda.se) where if I star a message in Slack, it will end up in my Things inbox for me to process at a later time. This makes handling Slack a lot easier, since I donâ€™t have to rely on marking conversations as unread just to remember to handle them at a later time.
