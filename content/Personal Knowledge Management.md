# Questions

Is working on your personal knowledge management system, creating notes, linking notes, all procrastinating?
- Resources critiquing note taking
	- https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baKCC2uTbRc
- Video I’m watching is like “making notes isn’t real work” where matushack is like “making notes is the only way to measure work for knowledge workers”
	- Is this more of a critique on how much time you can spend tinkering with tools, tags, etc., rather than actually writing?
		- Then where do you draw the line between tinkering for enjoyment, and having a brutalist system, where it's purely functional? Or how about creating an efficient environment that you actually enjoy using?
		- I think it probably comes down to self-awareness here. What's the ratio of time spent tinkering to time spent doing the work that'll move your forward?
