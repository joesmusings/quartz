## Curtis McHale
- Uses tags for thisweek, nextweek, and thismonth
- He'll then go through those and schedule "thisweek" tasks over the week, Mon-Fri
- He makes sure that all tasks in his system has one of the timebased-tags

## Tiago Forte
- Inbox
	- Captures all actions here, obv
	- Will assign a priority tag, either "high" for has to be done this week or "medium" for things that can be done after this week
		- Able to assign a shortcut to a tag, then press Control + shortcut to assign it
		
	- Then he moves it to the repective project or area
- Selecting this for Today/This Week
	- Anytime -> filter for tag Priority/HIgh 
- Today
	- Uses Today view as "this week" 
	- He doesn't separate out his today view by project or area, but rather with custom headings ![[Pasted image 20231103075306.png]]
	- 



One thing I don't understand, is that Tiago uses both the Today view and High priority to denote what he wants to do this week, so why does he only add some things into his Today view?

## Christoper Lawley
- Uses research & tracking area to track things like books to read, video games to play, movies to watch
	- These are each projects, then have headings to further define, ex. PS5 vs Switch Games
- Heavy use of shortcuts
- Also tracks the tasks that other people have to do as a waiting o, if your neck is on the line too.
