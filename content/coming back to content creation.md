Consistency vs persistence, and feeling bad about not following through.

Content

Just over a year ago, I joined the [Small Bets Community](https://smallbets.com). There are plenty of workshops on different topics that are recorded and uploaded, so occasionally I'll peruse the catalog for a topic of interest.

And right there in the recordings directory lay a workshop titled "Growing on Substack" by @Elle Griffin. 

Now content creation, specifically writing, has been a part of my life that I can't exactly ween myself off of. 

As most things go, a burst of initial motivation and inspiration fuels you along far enough to stay consistent for a few weeks, maybe a few months. But once the self-accountability wears out, the project falls into the graveyard of experiments.

Except writing.

There's something about writing that, over these past 3 years of sprinting and hibernating, just sticks with me. My other projects, I can forget about. Relegate to years past as a fun experiment that didn't quite catch on.

Writing, the bastard, just won't seem to die.

I had been on substack before, when I had titled my newsletter "Effortless Action" when I was more focused on motivation and taking action, based on a concept called Wu Wei. After starting, I had become more interested in ownership, customization, and control. So I migrated everything to self-hosted Ghost.

And now, hearing from Elle how Substack is nowadays -- being more interested in community, wanting to interact with other writers, and hopefully put out content thtats useful -- awakened the need to write once more. 

So this week, I migrated everything back to Substack.

(This isn't a post about where to host your newsletter, I promise.) 

As I was migrating posts over, the dates, the gaps between publishing mocked me.

A month of daily posts in March of 2021.

A sprint of 12 at the end of 2021.

A whole 2 posts in May of 2022.

And a sprint of 10 in the summer of 2023.

It felt bad. I felt like a failure. This thing that I care about, writing and putting content out into the universe, an attempt to help others live lives the enjoy, I was falling flat.

But where does that feeling come from?

Content creation advice touts consistency as one of the pillars of growing. How can you improve if you don't get your reps in? You cant close the gap between your taste and your work without a portfolio.

We see the greatest writers and their immovable writing routines, while we look at our own crafts, our hobbies, with a longingness for the ability to put that much time into it and replace our day jobs. The greats like Seth Godin and Steven Pressfield preach professionalism - showing up - above all else, and shipping when the work needs to be shipped.



How do we balance the Wu Wei, go with the flow, with the consistency principle?

Deadlines give us eustress, the pressure to shop up, less we be at odds with our promise to ourselves. 

But effortless action says, "why try to swim upstream?" If it's not right, if there is too much friction or tension, then something is wrong.

People strugglng with forward momentum need to hear that you need to keep putting in the work. (Jay Acunzo)

@Sam Sager talks about self-renewing systems, using a gardening metaphor

"if we try to push the harvest (publishing) more aggresively than we've built up the fertility (practice) we can't sustain it as a self-renewing system."

Does the cadence matter if you have a consistent harvest?

My issue with publishing content wasn't that I just wasn't posting enough, but it was a signal. A signal that something wasn't right with the system. Brute force publishing content for content's sake means there's something wrong with the system supporting it, it wasn't just a character flaw that I'm not good at taking action.

It's the persistence, the commitment to improving the system 

You have to know the why behind your consistency.

Do you want to play into and optimize for an algorithm? Are you a brand that needs to stay top of mind for consumers? Does the content or product require speed and timeliness?

Then the consistency of product matters. (output)

Do you care more about the quality of your product? Is there a specific craft you're trying to hone?

Then the consistency of practice matters. (input)

If you don't show the product of your practice, it'll have internal benefits, but won't have a direct impact on the outside world. Understand that shipping still matters. Commiting to a consistency of practice lets the product happen naturally, but you have to be aware of the pipeline.

Are you sitting on too many ideas? Not honing the craft of writing, but instead the craft of idea generation? Is that okay with you? Or are you spending too much time "searching for inspiration" on social media, and not commiting to the craft that you're really trying to hone.

Focusing on consistency of product helps us cut away the BS of whats necessary to ship. But once you understand that writers need to write, painters need to paint, entrepreneurs need to build, do you need that consistency of product? Or are you able to reflect on your practice and guide yourself back on the right track when need be?




It's a fine line between understanding when something becomes a product. The creator has to decide.

If you tell and audience you're going to show up weekly, that's what they'll expect. And thats what some producers need. Some producers need that deadline, and are able to ship a pretty good product week in and out. 

If you tell them that you're going to show up with a product when you have somthing to share with them, then that's what they'll expect.


If its not something you're being paid to show up for, then why not put your head down for a while and hone your craft? 

Sure, engage with the community you want to be a part of, stay top of mind, share what you're working on. But have a place to put your high quality stuff.



The past is in the past, there's nothing we can do to ship yesterday. All we can do is start again. Where is your compass pointing? Take a step in that direction

Do you want to ship work, but haven't yet? Start with commiting to a product every week for 12 weeks. No tutorials, no optimization, you have the info you need.

Have you shipped in the past, but have fallen off because you're not happy with the product? Commit to a consistency of practice, with an eye on how much you're shipping. By all means, have an output goal that you can judge against, but don't sacrifice your craft for an arbitrary deadline.

For me, writing feels so good. But it's so difficult to convince myself that it's the case. When I finally make sense of the scramble inside of my head, find the perfect sentence to describe it, and chisel at the structure of the piece to create something new, it fills my cup.

Though it seems like every time I step away, my memories are wiped. I forget the feeling that it brings, and it's so difficult to get back into the motions again.
