## My journey
- Learning hiragana & katakana
	- I started out with Tofugu's guide on learning hiragana and katakana. I probably took a little longer than most to get through them, but I had a really good feel for hiragana. Katakana, was a bit more iffy though
- Wani Kani - started October 2022
	- After learning those I dived into wani kani. I signed up for a membership and everything. I got up to level 3, but kinda burned out from it. I was learning some kanji and some vocab, but it didn't feel right. I would get frustrated with the tool, and it would kill my mood. I realized that I need something with a little bit more context. Reviews would pile up, and I just wasn't happy with it. 
- I tried doing a lesson in Genki 1, but just wasn't feeling it.
- A long break
	- I took a long break, like, a year. Kind of feels bad, if I would have just started and stuck with something, I'd have really good progress by now. But all I can do  is start fresh now.
- Restarting - March 2024
	- I'm pretty comfortable with kana, but it's something I need to increase speed with. I want to practice for at least 5 minutes twice a day.
	- Main method I'll be starting out with is the 30 Day Japanese (UsagiSpoon) form TheMoeWay
		- This expects 3 hours a day of practice, which definitely isn't in the cards for me, but I'll take it one step at a time
	- I will track all of my time via toggl
	- Starting immersion with Flying Witch - subtitle tutor method
