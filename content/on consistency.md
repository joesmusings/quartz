Brandon Sanderson had written 12 novels, but not a single had sold. Those around him were worried, bugging him about needing to make money and get a real career.

So he stopped and asked himself:
"Would I be okay if I died in my 100s with 150 unpublished manuscripts?"[^1]

And the answer was yes. Maybe the pace was a bit ambitious, and he'd have to get some sort of 'real job,' But he came to the conclusion that he'd definitely keep writing. 

This reframing of success turns actions from a finite, achievable goal, to an infinite game focused on sustainability, to continue 'playing the game.' 


Steven Pressfield was 52 when his first book was published. When asked, he attributes his consistency to:

"I just couldn't do anything else and be happy."[^2]
 
He would feel awful about his day job, go home, and write "something real."
