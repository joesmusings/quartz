- ideas
	- who are you? who am i? words are shallow, and don't get the whole picture of who you are
	- plus, we're always changing. so how do you have a base of things you can always come back to, while still being adaptable?
	- from me: what if you reflected each day on how you acted in line with the values you held? both positively and negatively?
- actions
	- find list of core values (like 200 of them)
	- choose your top 20, narrow it to 10, then to 5
		- make sure its coming from the inside, not from other's notion of who you are
	-
