Sometimes we feel down, like everything's too much. Here's my: [[Theory - How to get unstuck|Theory on how to get unstuck (In Progress)]]

You should have crystal clear clarity on what you should be working on at the given moment. Hemmingway stopped each writing session in the middle of a sentence so he didn't have any problem starting the next time.

When you have something time blocked, you have two options (from [[Neil Gaiman - Do the thing or do nothing]]):
1. do the thing
2. do nothing
