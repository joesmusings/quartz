From "How John McPhee's Slow Writing Process Produced Deep Articles" by Cal Newport


John McPhee would take tons of notes and tapes that he took, transcribed and tuped them into a tupewriter, scenned and copied them, then cut out each separate note and organized them. Then, he'd make overall index card summaries and sort and mess around with the structure.

The friction, the slowness, marinating with the ideas, is what makes the work great. Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene use notecards in a similar way.

We've had this cult of productivity and efficiency that has given rise to wanting ro remove this friction

I can't say with confidence that I know of many accomplished writerrs who have a frictionless process where they're obsessed with Reaadwise integrations and obsidian graphs. Most of those poeple are hobbyist and meta creators.
