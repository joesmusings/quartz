- intro
- the problem
	- "look at my stripe account, you can have this too if you just buy my course"
	- the incentives of creators
		- people in the creator economy are incentivized to get your attention, your clicks, and your money, in order to keep sustaining their business
			- it leads to best practices, tactics, hacks, and unfulfilled promises of a better life
			- keep you on that drip supply of content - "maybe the next one will be the one that finally helps me"
- the solution
	- two types of anti-creators
		- 1. the people who care about the craft of creating
		- 2. the people who care about the selfish benefits of creating
	- builders, writers, artisans, craftspeople. or, just being selfish
		- is art inherently selfish
	- being an anti-creator isn't about not making things, but rather going against the common content creator perception
- taking action
	- website
	- discord



- there's been a disconnect in my head around content publishing.
	- a world of publishing content because you said you were going to publish content, vs 

Anti-creators
- Dedicated to creating content, mostly for themselves
- only publishing high quality, but not restrictive on perfectionism - not focused on monetization through courses, Monetization is an after thought,
- focused on creating content for two main reasons 
	- Clarify your own thoughts-becoming a better thinker
		- Seneca said "Qui docet discit" - he who teaches learns
	- positively contributing to your field/the internet through content
- inherently anti-niche and more self-focused - making it the ultimate niche of one
- anti growth, leading to growth - focus on quality and not attention
- focus on content around reflection. not roadmaps & cheap clickbait 
	- "how I" not "how to"
- intrinsically motivated content creation
- "the people we learn from best are often the ones who are just a step ahead of us in the journey"
	- "You don't need to be a guru. You can just be a guide."
	- "Seeing people similar to oneself succeed by sustained effort raises observers' beliefs that they too possess the capabilities to master comparable activities to succeed." 
	Seeing others perform
threatening activities without adverse con-
sequences can generate expectations in ob-
servers that they too will improve if they
intensify and persist in their efforts.

		- This is why you should be 
 
How to monetize?
- taking money from businesses, not consumers
	- ads & affiliates
- non content products 
	- no courses
- Direct contribution 
	- is pay walled content okay? 
	- maybe matuschak model
	- increased access
- 1000 true fans
	- $100 of products each year = 100k yearly revenue

Anticreators.com and r/anticreators are available

So sick of the cringe webinars that don't give you any information, but end up telling you that the real Stuff is in the course 

A rejection of best practices and a focus on what's necessitated out of the problem

How serious should the discord be? Could make it paid, but would that be counter to the main point of the community? Or could get inspiration from Alcoholics Anonymous

- anti-creator guidelines
	- don't follow the guidelines (if you don't want to )
		- of the anti-creator definition, or of any definition for that matter
	- the niche is you
	- no publishing cadence, only publishing when you have something today
		- instead, replace this with a creation habit. ex. writing every day instead of publishing everyday
	- anti-perfectionist
		- put something out there regardless if you think it's perfect. you can adapt later
