- concert recordings
	- seeing sungazer and recording bits
		- gf's mom asked for us to record a little bit
		- love watching back through those and re-living through those little snippets
			- even without those snippets, listening to their music brings me back. When "All These People" moves into half-ish time I remember the feeling of headbanging - whipping my hair around, and just getting lost in the music. I so wish I could expereince that again, but I absolutley loved being there and ffeeleing it, and luckily I get tiny smidgens of that feeling still comeback when i listen to the song
				- or in threshold when the bass drops and i could remember Yee screeeaaaming into the sax
	- so we went to go see my favorite band
		- recording a couple of almost full songs that were my favorites
		- except during this, it was taking up a thread
			- "am i getting the framing right, am i covering up the microphone, etc."
- apple vision pro
	- as technology improves, being able to live in past experiences (or even experiences of others, another topic for another day) will get even more real. 
	- if you had a spatial camera (like the iphone 15 pro quite a few people already have in their pockets), and the a recorded feed, not through the speakers, but what is sent to the speakers, then all you need is a vision pro and a really good set of speakers, and you can really re-live that concert. 
	- i'm sure it'll still feel remarkably different for the near future, but I could imagine us getting 80-90% there in not too long
	- so, what'll make experiencing these things IRL any different
	- will musicians turn into weekly live streamers once apple, meta, and google makes sure that each home is stocked with a virtual reality?
		- will the marginal experience gain make traveling a couple hours and spending a couple hundred dollars not so worth it anymore, will live music get spotified the way buying albums did?
- on youtube - "how documenting my life changed my life"

- sacrificing presence for reliving
	- even just thinking "i'd like to record a little bit of this" takes up some of your brains processing power
		- could you more efficiently use it to enjoy the experience?
		- whats the ROI of using that to fully experience it vs having clips that can let you re-live it?
		- is your brain even able to full experience it, or would that "thread" frequently go off on other rabbit holes?
- our memories are fragile
	- they quickly decay, and even if they don't, can easily be rewritten. 
	- I hardly remember the first time i saw a7x, couldn't even tell you what year it was.

other media
- live music aside, we end up having a quantity vs quality problem
- i recent got rid of almost 700 videos i was hoarding in my watch later playlist, and just about 600 emails i had let pile up in my inbox. 
	- when i confronted them, there were two main questions i asked myself
		- how long will it take me to get through these?
		- what would happen if these just dissapeared
	- when it came to both, the answers were
		- way too long
		- probably nothing
	- there were probably a few nuggets in there that i could have added to my PKM or some optimizations or things that I could try that i'm missing out on
		- but i think being okay with missing out on these things, and instead trusting that, if i spend some alone time with my brain, we can work out something as good as, if not better, than what i would've gotten out of that content
		- it's a leap of faith though, watching content is like playing the lottery for me. i was glued to the screen, pulling the lever on each video i clicked on, hoping that this was the one that would give me the jackpot - the nugget of content that would fix my problems.
		- except, because of the quantity i was consuming, any jackpots that i would get would just be eaten up through more spins

we see capturing these things as productive, because if we didn't, what do we have to show for? 

one day, the memory of the events we hold dearest will disappear, but we have the ability to capture them. but when we capture them, our presence is split. its a beautifully horrific balance that captures the human condition.

the quantity of your camera roll is far less important than the quality. 

- engaging more deeply with fewer pieces of media
	- I think the reason i so enjoyed the sungazer and avenged concerts were because they were few and far between.
