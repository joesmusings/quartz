When people normally takl about discipline, then usually reach for either "willpower" or "habit." However, DR K posits that discipline is actaully an emoition. Take addictions, for example. Soemoen who is an addict needs discipline. But for them, they need emotional help through psychoterapy, not just more willpower. That's what gets them through it.


Negative emotinos are location based, aka anatomical. However, positive emotions are circuit based, with no main center


Opposite things are in the same category 
- light and heavy are weights
- dark and bright is light
- hot and cold are temperature
so this also applies to discipline:

doubt, or a wavering mind is the opposite of discipline. Think marriage or pifcking a college major

So whats the opposite of doubt? _resolve_

You don't need discipline, you need resolve. Internal resolve presents as external discipline. This resolve is actually an emotion

Positive emotionss, including resolve, come from circuits in the brain. You want to cultivate resolve on a daily basis (neurons that fire together wire together) not just habit and willpower. But we're not good at activating those curcuits.

1. notice when you feel resolved
	- close your eyes and take a snapshot of it
	- whats the experienve?
	- fuels your willpower
	- there's a core that lets you dismiss distractions
2. sankalpa
	- pick one thing you want to be resolved for
	- make sure its medium difficulty, not super important
	- every day within the first 60-90 minutes, think about the resolve for 5-10 mins, feel the emotion of it, stoke the fire
3. also try this with more global resolve
	- instead of just project or activity based
	- can be derived from values like "i deserve to be whole"
	- maybe try this after a month of step 2

this practce is about cultivating the positive emotional circuits

lack of self discipline = emotionally numb
