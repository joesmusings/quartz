# Tension of hard work
I have a lot of tension in my head around this idea of hard work

people like joe abercrombie, super sucecssful author, says that he'd rather take a grater to his eyes than write. So why does he do it? How does he do it? 

Shouldn't we just be working on things that we enjoy, that we're naturally motivated to do? Or would that natural motivation just lead to a paht of hedonism?

So we should do some hard things, but how do we know the difference between hard things that are bad to work on and those that are good to work on? is it a percentage thing, like 70% of the time I enjoy writing, but only 50% of doing web desingn, so I should pursue writing?

Or is it more of a use of leverage thing? This whole rabbit hole feels like it's going towards cal's SGTCIY, which I think is pretty decent but just feel s off to me for some reason.

Dr.K talks about how its about how you feel after you've done something. Do you feel guilty for being hedonistic afterwards? That means you should probably avoid it. Is something difficult, and afterwards you don't feel good about it? Probably avoid. Feels bad in the moment, but you feel great about yourself after? Do more of that.
