- An ode to thinking more
- How can we incorporate more thinking into our life? How can we wrestle with ideas, and output less, but better?
- Instead of contributing to an endless grind of outputting whatever is top of mind, and calling it golden, what if we took less action and thought through things more
- Not trying to predict and making assumptions, but more reflection, talking to ourselves, rather than blind action
- How do we make sure that we're taking *enough* action? That we aren't using thinking as a way to procrastinate making progress on our dreams?
- What does it look like to get paid for thinking?
	- transforming knowledge into value
- How can we become better thinkers?

What does thinking *as* action look like? I think it looks like writing, in an effortful way. Working on good questions. Not over analyzing, but 

# **Why a bias for action is killing your productivity**
I was raised in the whole "take massive action" section of self development YouTube. When you’re focused on taking action for actions sake, you end up pulling in the thing closest to you. Or if you have an idea you just start working on it. 

What if you’re not motivated to do anything though? For me, that manifested in a “wanting to take action” but proceeding to just procrastinate it. I have an idea that I want to build a product used service but I’m procrastinating it because I should just do it.   

Instead what if we spent more time thinking? 

Thinking about the scope of the problem, really engaging with it intellectually. Not just tweaking a management system but legitimately planning out the steps, considerations, actions, and reasons behind it all?
