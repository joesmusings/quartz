intrinsic motivation = enjoying the process
focusing on your big dreams, externalizes and extrinsifies your motivation
it creates a gap between where you are today and where you want to be

so you have a big dream, why do you want that? try doing the "5 whys" exercise to dive deeper into the actual reason

but what about big hairy audatious goals? what about 10x mindset?
