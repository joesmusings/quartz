"The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading" [Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6GNVv6RyFDewy11ZgXzce8agWxSLwJ6Ub5Rw)
	- "It’s not that they’ve so deeply internalized and automatized those practices that they seem invisible: they’re just not doing those things."
		- "They read for a purpose"
		- ["Many eminent thinkers need a writing surface to think"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2)

Cal Newport talks about this too
- So then whats the solve?
	- Should the process naturally evolve? Instead of using someone else's process?
	- Is there some sort of simple baseline that people use that is a common thread between them all?
	- It's possible that we just need more effective engagement with the material. More time and space to actually think. It comes down to a balance of not being system-obsessed, rather content-obsessed. 
		- The truth is it doesn't matter what sort of system you have. The more time you spend concerned on the system is the less time you can focus on the content.
		- The technology and system stack is there to serve you. It's there to personalize the workflow to the way that works best with you. 
		- The big thinkers who have messy desks with papers notes and books strewn about, that's their personal system. 
		- Its about adapting the personal side of it to you
