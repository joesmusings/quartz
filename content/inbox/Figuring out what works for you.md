# Figuring out what works for you
I was watching DrK's video on what he struggles with. He said that once he understood his personality type, and started to align his work, and sense of worth, things drastically changed.

Brandon Sanderson also talks about this, in the sense of figuring out what gets you to do the thing that you want to have done. For him, he really loves watching the progress bar of the book he's working on move up. For others, they need a reward, others need to avoid punishment
