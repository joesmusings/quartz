If you want to be in control of your life, you have to learn how to do something for no reason. If you require a reason to do something, you're beholden to the outside world. We've been conditioned to act because of something, a reaon.

"I don't have motivation" - we thingk we need to have motivation, but what if you didn't need motivation to take action?

We don't know what the consequenves of our actions are, we need to act first, then learn about the consequences. We're afraid to lose, so we're afraid to act.
