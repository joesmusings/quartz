# When does anti productivity go to far?


When it’s something you enjoy. Ex. If it gives you joy to organize your productivity system, if it energizes you 

Can kind of apply what Oliver burkman talks about in 4000 weeks

Treat productivity like a hobby, it shouldn't be a replacement for actually doing work, but if it's something you enjoy tinkering with, have protected time to actually do it!
