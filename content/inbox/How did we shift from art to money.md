# How did we shift from art to money?
I'm curious as to the cultural shifts where the renaissance saw art as wealth, rather than just pure capital number, or having a fancy house or possession from a certain thing.

Like at the highest levels I'm sure there's still a lot of that "exclusive art" thing going on, but at the end of the day its just speculative investments

I wonder if memetic desire plays a roll in any of this
