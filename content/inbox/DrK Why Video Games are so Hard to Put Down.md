DrK breaks down the process into feedback loops, or reinforcement. Video games provide that instant dopamine, sense of progress, clear objectives, etc. Whereas when we take action on our goals, we end up having self doubt, feeling like we should gave done more, etc.

1. Capture our waves of inspiration
2. Reflecting on them often
3. Being grateful for and and all steps in the right direction
