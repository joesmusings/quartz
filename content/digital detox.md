### march 10th
- archived my whole personal email inbox (>600 emails)
- removed almost 700 videos from my watch later list on youtube
	- down to like 20 videos now

### march 13th
- have been consistent with meditation and journaling practice every morning
- have found that restricting my time on youtube has had a positive impact so far
	- i've been going for higher quality things
	- the first couple of days i spent watching some more generic videos and realizing just how low value a lot of this stuff is
	- so now i've been pushing for more in depth, higher quality, podcast style, longer form content on youtube
